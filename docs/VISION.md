# Vision

RelayTrace provides a supervisory control plane for autonomous agents.

Core outcome: organizations can scale agent autonomy **without losing human accountability**.

Design principles:
1. Agent-framework agnostic integration contract
2. Human approvals as first-class runtime events
3. Escalation policy correctness over raw automation speed
4. Operator-scoped mission-control visibility
5. Durable, auditable action history
