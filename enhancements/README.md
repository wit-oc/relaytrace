# RelayTrace Enhancements Backlog

This folder stores future enhancement concepts that are intentionally deferred while core functionality is prioritized.

Guidelines:
- Keep entries concise and implementation-oriented.
- Link each idea to an existing track when possible (telemetry/KPI, approvals, reliability, etc.).
- Include: problem, proposed mechanism, success metric, risks, and earliest prototype.
