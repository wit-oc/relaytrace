# relaytrace-strands-adapter (scaffold)

Minimal package scaffold for a Strands decorator/wrapper integration with RelayTrace HITL workflows.

## Planned public surface
- `relaytrace_supervised(...)` decorator
- `RelayTraceDecisionClient` for poll/pull of decisions
- typed payloads for request/decision/audit events

## Status
Scaffold only. Runtime internals are placeholders pending transport + API integration.
